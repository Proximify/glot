# Collections

It is common for GLOT components, specially widget components, to belong to a **collection**. A collection is simply the idea that a set of GLOT components can be part of a coherent whole.

A collection is similar to the concepts of libraries and toolkits for HTML, JS, and CSS. For example, jQuery is a JS library while Bootstrap is a toolkit of CSS and JS components. In a similar spirit, a GLOT collection is a grouping of widgets that are meant to be used together.

The [Glot Bazaar](http://glotbazaar.com) makes it easy to [navigate collections](http://glotbazaar.com/collections) and find website templates and widgets that follow consistent design principles.

Developers can [create new collections](#create-new-collections) and add components to them.
